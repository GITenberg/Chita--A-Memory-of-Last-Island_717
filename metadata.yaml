description: A traveler with insatiable wanderlust, journalist and ethnographer Lafcadio
  Hearn spent much of his life journeying to new and unfamiliar cultures. After spending
  some time in New Orleans, Hearn became interested in the fate of a barrier island
  off the Gulf Coast that had been destroyed by a tropical storm. It is this doomed
  island that forms the centerpiece of Hearn's engrossing novel Chita.
